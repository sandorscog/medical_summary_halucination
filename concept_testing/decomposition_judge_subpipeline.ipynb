Paracentesis was attempted in the ED but was unsuccessful. Lab results showed elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST, Alk Phos, Total Bili), and a low platelet count. A CXR showed no acute cardiopulmonary process. Ultrasound revealed liver nodularity, signs of portal hypertension (ascites and splenomegaly), and cholelithiasis.

She was discharged home in a clear and coherent mental state, alert, interactive, and ambulatory, with a diagnosis of ascites from portal hypertension.

      " A healthy female with no known drug allergies was admitted to Urology for an incidental right renal mass, which was confirmed as renal cell carcinoma. She underwent a right laparoscopic radical nephrectomy without intraoperative complications. Post-operatively, her pain was managed, initially with PCA then transitioning to oral analgesics. She received perioperative antibiotics, hydration, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary complications. Her Foley catheter was removed on post-operative day one, and her diet was advanced as tolerated. Her hospital course was unremarkable. She was discharged home in stable condition, ambulating independently, eating well, voiding without difficulty, and with her pain well controlled on oral medication. Her surgical incision was clean, dry, and intact.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon discharge, she was prescribed Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen for breakthrough pain and Docusate Sodium for constipation. She was instructed to shower but avoid bathing or swimming, limit lifting to no more than 10 pounds, and refrain from driving until her follow-up appointment. Tylenol was recommended as her primary pain relief, with narcotics reserved for breakthrough pain. She was advised to avoid constipating foods, drink plenty of fluids, and resume her home medications, holding NSAIDs until her follow-up. She was also educated on warning signs such as fever over 101.5F, vomiting, or increased redness, swelling, or discharge from the incision, which would warrant contacting her doctor or visiting the emergency room. A follow-up appointment with her Urologist in three weeks was scheduled. \n",

Instructions included avoiding bathing, swimming, driving until follow-up, and limiting lifting to under 10 pounds, with Tylenol recommended as first-line pain relief. She was advised to resume home medications but to hold NSAIDs until follow-up, and to seek medical attention for fevers above 101.5 F, vomiting, or a worsening incision.

    "    The patient is a female with a history of HCV cirrhosis complicated by ascites and hepatic encephalopathy, HIV on HAART, COPD, and hyponatremia. She was admitted with abdominal fullness and discomfort following a recent discharge after paracentesis, due to re-accumulation of ascites associated with increased abdominal distention and pain. She also experienced visual hallucinations and forgetfulness, findings suggestive of hepatic encephalopathy. Upon discharge, she was independently ambulatory and had a clear mental status. Her primary discharge diagnosis was diuretic-refractory ascites, with secondary diagnoses of HCV cirrhosis, HIV, hyponatremia, and COPD. She was instructed to continue a low-sodium diet and fluid restriction, and to return to the emergency room for any worsening abdominal pain or fever. Discharge medications included her HIV regimen, lactulose, rifaximin, and Bactrim.\n",
